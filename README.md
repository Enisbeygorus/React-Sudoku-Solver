This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Hello Everyone

In this project i try to create a website that can solve the sudoku problem. This is my very first React project
for school thesis so codes are not clean and not professional.

Credit for algorithm: http://norvig.com/sudoku.html

## Getting started.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000] to view it in the browser.

## What can we do with this project ?

 In "Play Sudoku" tab in the header you can play sudoku. If you click "test button" you will
receive random sudoku problem. If you don't follow the rules grid will warn you for example
if you write two same number in the same row that grids with the same number will turn red so
there is a mistake there and we can one of the same number.

 If you can't solve it by yourself there is a button "Solve the Puzzle" that solve all the puzzle for you.
 With "Save Puzzle and Solution" you can save your solved puzzles in the "Solved Puzzle" tab.
 
 In "Sudoku Solver" tab you can write your own sudoku problem and let the algorithm solve it for you.
 
That's all hope you can enjoy it and have fun.
Thank you for reading.
